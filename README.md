# DIY Eurorack Case Planner Tool
This is a simple one-page HTML app for messing around with planning how to build a DIY (cardboard) eurorack case. My original intent was just to create a tool that would allow me to visualize the angle for a 6U system case and gauge what amount of deskspace (and airspace) it would consume.

It is loosely based on the [Future Music guide for how to build your own cardboard eurorack modular case](http://www.musicradar.com/tuition/tech/how-to-build-your-own-cardboard-eurorack-modular-case-625196) and the accompanying PDF [CardboardCaseGuide](http://cdn.mos.musicradar.com/images/aaaroot/tech/7july15/DIY-Eurorack-case/CardboardCaseGuide.zip). 

This currently only shows the measurements for the side view of the case, and currently does not take into account the 5mm cardboard thickness if one were to construct the case similarly to the way the one on the Future Music guide would. (will fix this in future check in)
